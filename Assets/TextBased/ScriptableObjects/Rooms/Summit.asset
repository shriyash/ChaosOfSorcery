  description: 'After climbing the staricase you come accross the summit, an ornate
    velvet room, starlight washing in and lighting the strange place. The door slams
    behind you but your nerves are steady.  You look around, worried the one you
    seek has already fled, only to turn and see him. A hulking figure, a demon in
    robes, stands on the opposite side of you. His wings stretch as he brings up
    his wand, a rotten shaft of worm bitten wood which pulses with dark energy.
