  description: "The days blend to weeks as one voyages upon skyships, and your trip
    is no exception. Days of shaky steps and groaning wooden floors have done quite
    a number on you. Oh, the sacrifices you must make for the realm. You are a staff
    mage, sent by your order to cripple your major rival, the wand mages. You have
    been trained for many a month, and have now finally prepared yourself to arrive
    at the den of that order itself, their great sky tower.\r\n\r\nFInally, as the
    ship draws to a stop, you step out onto the tower\u2019s skydock. A crowd of
    folk of varying ilks flood out with you, allowing you to take advantage and slip
    into the dock proper. The dock itself is a great room, like a half cylinder,
    made of raw stone and metal. Various wand mages meander about, unaware of the
    serpent in their midst.\r\n"
